## Why use Cognita?

Langchain/LlamaIndex provide easy to use abstractions that can be used for quick experimentation and prototyping on jupyter notebooks. But, when things move to production, there are constraints like the components should be modular, easily scalable and extendable. This is where Cognita comes in action.
Cognita uses Langchain/Llamaindex under the hood and provides an organisation to your codebase, where each of the RAG component is modular, API driven and easily extendible. Cognita can be used easily in a [local](#rocket-quickstart-running-cognita-locally) setup, at the same time, offers you a production ready environment along with no-code [UI](./frontend/README.md) support. Cognita also supports incremental indexing by default.

## Introduction

Cognita is an open-source framework to organize your RAG codebase along with a frontend to play around with different RAG customizations. It provides a simple way to organize your codebase so that it becomes easy to test it locally while also being able to deploy it in a production ready environment. The key issues that arise while productionizing RAG system from a Jupyter Notebook are:

1. **Chunking and Embedding Job**: The chunking and embedding code usually needs to be abstracted out and deployed as a job. Sometimes the job will need to run on a schedule or be triggered via an event to keep the data updated.
2. **Query Service**: The code that generates the answer from the query needs to be wrapped up in a api server like FastAPI and should be deployed as a service. This service should be able to handle multiple queries at the same time and also autoscale with higher traffic.
3. **LLM / Embedding Model Deployment**: Often times, if we are using open-source models, we load the model in the Jupyter notebook. This will need to be hosted as a separate service in production and model will need to be called as an API.
4. **Vector DB deployment**: Most testing happens on vector DBs in memory or on disk. However, in production, the DBs need to be deployed in a more scalable and reliable way.

Cognita makes it really easy to customize and experiment everything about a RAG system and still be able to deploy it in a good way. It also ships with a UI that makes it easier to try out different RAG configurations and see the results in real time. You can use it locally or with/without using any Truefoundry components. However, using Truefoundry components makes it easier to test different models and deploy the system in a scalable way. Cognita allows you to host multiple RAG systems using one app.

### Advantages of using Cognita are:

1. A central reusable repository of parsers, loaders, embedders and retrievers.
2. Ability for non-technical users to play with UI - Upload documents and perform QnA using modules built by the development team.
3. Fully API driven - which allows integration with other systems.
    > If you use Cognita with Truefoundry AI Gateway, you can get logging, metrics and feedback mechanism for your user queries.

### Features:

1. Support for multiple document retrievers that use `Similarity Search`, `Query Decompostion`, `Document Reranking`, etc
1. Support for SOTA OpenSource embeddings and reranking from `mixedbread-ai`
1. Support for using LLMs using `ollama`
1. Support for incremental indexing that ingests entire documents in batches (reduces compute burden), keeps track of already indexed documents and prevents re-indexing of those docs.

# :rocket: Quickstart: Running Cognita Locally

## :whale: Using Docker compose (recommended - version 25+)

Cognita and all of its services can be run using docker-compose. This is the recommended way to run Cognita locally. Install Docker and docker-compose for your system from: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Configuring Model Providers

Before starting the services, we need to configure model providers that we would need for embedding and generating answers.

To start, copy `models_config.sample.yaml` to `models_config.yaml`

```shell
cp models_config.sample.yaml models_config.yaml
```

By default, the config has local providers enabled that need infinity and ollama server to run embedding and LLMs locally.
However, if you have a OpenAI API Key, you can uncomment the `openai` provider in `models_config.yaml` and update `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `compose.env`


Now, you can run the following command to start the services:

```shell
docker-compose --env-file compose.env up
```

-   The compose file uses `compose.env` file for environment variables. You can modify it as per your needs.
-   The compose file will start the following services:
    -   `cognita-db` - Postgres instance used to store metadata for collections and data sources.
    -   `qdrant-server` - Used to start local vector db server.
    -   `cognita-backend` - Used to start the FastAPI backend server for Cognita.
    -   `cognita-frontend` - Used to start the frontend for Cognita.
-   Once the services are up, you can access the qdrant server at `http://localhost:6333`, the backend at `http://localhost:8000` and frontend at `http://localhost:5001`.

To start additional services such as `ollama` and `infinity-server` you can run the following command:

```shell
docker-compose --env-file compose.env --profile ollama --profile infinity up
```

-   This will start additional servers for `ollama` and `infinity-server` which can be used for LLM, Embeddings and reranking respectively. You can access the `infinity-server` at `http://localhost:7997`.


## Developing in Cognita

Docker compose is a great way to run the entire Cognita system locally. Any changes that you make in the `backend` folder will be automatically reflected in the running backend server. You can test out different APIs and endpoints by making changes in the backend code.

If you want to build backend / frontend image locally, for e.g when you add new requirements/packages you can run `docker-compose build` before running `docker-compose up`

# :hammer_and_pick: Project Architecture

![](./docs/images/rag_arch.png)

Overall the architecture of Cognita is composed of several entities

## Cognita Components:

1. **Data Sources** - These are the places that contain your documents to be indexed. Usually these are S3 buckets, databases, TrueFoundry Artifacts or even local disk

2. **Metadata Store** - This store contains metadata about the collection themselves. A collection refers to a set of documents from one or more data sources combined. For each collection, the collection metadata stores

    - Name of the collection
    - Name of the associated Vector DB collection
    - Linked Data Sources
    - Parsing Configuration for each data source
    - Embedding Model and Configuration to be used

3. **LLM Gateway** - This is a central proxy that allows proxying requests to various Embedding and LLM models across many providers with a unified API format. This can be OpenAIChat, OllamaChat, or even TruefoundryChat that uses TF LLM Gateway.

4. **Vector DB** - This stores the embeddings and metadata for parsed files for the collection. It can be queried to get similar chunks or exact matches based on filters. We are currently supporting `Qdrant` and `SingleStore` as our choice of vector database.

5. **Indexing Job** - This is an asynchronous Job responsible for orchestrating the indexing flow. Indexing can be started manually or run regularly on a cron schedule. It will

    - Scan the Data Sources to get list of documents
    - Check the Vector DB state to filter out unchanged documents
    - Downloads and parses files to create smaller chunks with associated metadata
    - Embeds those chunks using the AI Gateway and puts them into Vector DB
        > The source code for this is in the `backend/indexer/`

6. **API Server** - This component processes the user query to generate answers with references synchronously. Each application has full control over the retrieval and answer process. Broadly speaking, when a user sends a request

    - The corresponsing Query Controller bootstraps retrievers or multi-step agents according to configuration.
    - User's question is processed and embedded using the AI Gateway.
    - One or more retrievers interact with the Vector DB to fetch relevant chunks and metadata.
    - A final answer is formed by using a LLM via the AI Gateway.
    - Metadata for relevant documents fetched during the process can be optionally enriched. E.g. adding presigned URLs.
        > The code for this component is in `backend/server/`

## Data Indexing:

1. A Cron on some schedule will trigger the Indexing Job
1. The data source associated with the collection are **scanned** for all data points (files)
1. The job compares the VectorDB state with data source state to figure out **newly added files, updated files and deleted files**. The new and updated files are **downloaded**
1. The newly added files and updated files are **parsed and chunked** into smaller pieces each with their own metadata
1. The chunks are **embedded** using embedding models like `text-ada-002` from `openai` or `mxbai-embed-large-v1` from `mixedbread-ai`
1. The embedded chunks are put into VectorDB with auto generated and provided metadata

## :question: Question-Answering using API Server:

1. Users sends a request with their query

2. It is routed to one of the app's query controller

3. One or more retrievers are constructed on top of the Vector DB

4. Then a Question Answering chain / agent is constructed. It embeds the user query and fetches similar chunks.

5. A single shot Question Answering chain just generates an answer given similar chunks. An agent can do multi step reasoning and use many tools before arriving at an answer. In both cases, the API server uses LLM models (like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, etc)

6. Before returning the answer, the metadata for relevant chunks can be updated with things like presigned urls, surrounding slides, external data source links.

7. The answer and relevant document chunks are returned in response.

    **Note:** In case of agents the intermediate steps can also be streamed. It is up to the specific app to decide.

## Customizing the Code for your usecase

Cognita goes by the tagline -

> Everything is available and Everything is customizable.

Cognita makes it really easy to switch between parsers, loaders, models and retrievers.

### Customizing Dataloaders:

-   You can write your own data loader by inherting the `BaseDataLoader` class from `backend/modules/dataloaders/loader.py`

-   Finally, register the loader in `backend/modules/dataloaders/__init__.py`

-   Testing a dataloader on localdir, in root dir, copy the following code as `test.py` and execute it. We show how to test an existing `LocalDirLoader` here:

    ```python
    from backend.modules.dataloaders import LocalDirLoader
    from backend.types import DataSource

    data_source = DataSource(
    type="local",
    uri="sample-data/creditcards",
    )

    loader = LocalDirLoader()


    loaded_data_pts = loader.load_full_data(
        data_source=data_source,
        dest_dir="test/creditcards",
    )


    for data_pt in loaded_data_pts:
        print(data_pt)
    ```

### Customizing Embedder:

-   The codebase currently uses `OpenAIEmbeddings` you can registered as `default`.
-   You can register your custom embeddings in `backend/modules/embedder/__init__.py`
-   You can also add your own embedder an example of which is given under `backend/modules/embedder/mixbread_embedder.py`. It inherits langchain embedding class.

### Customizing Parsers:

-   You can write your own parser by inherting the `BaseParser` class from `backend/modules/parsers/parser.py`

-   Finally, register the parser in `backend/modules/parsers/__init__.py`

-   Testing a Parser on a local file, in root dir, copy the following code as `test.py` and execute it. Here we show how we can test existing `MarkdownParser`:

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from backend.modules.parsers import MarkdownParser

    parser = MarkdownParser()
    chunks =  asyncio.run(
        parser.get_chunks(
            filepath="sample-data/creditcards/diners-club-black.md",
        )
    )
    print(chunks)
    ```

### Adding Custom VectorDB:

-   To add your own interface for a VectorDB you can inhertit `BaseVectorDB` from `backend/modules/vector_db/base.py`

-   Register the vectordb under `backend/modules/vector_db/__init__.py`

# :bulb: Writing your Query Controller (QnA):

Code responsible for implementing the Query interface of RAG application. The methods defined in these query controllers are added routes to your FastAPI server.

## Steps to add your custom Query Controller:

-   Add your Query controller class in `backend/modules/query_controllers/`

-   Add `query_controller` decorator to your class and pass the name of your custom controller as argument

```controller.py
from backend.server.decorator import query_controller

@query_controller("/my-controller")
class MyCustomController():
    ...
```

-   Add methods to this controller as per your needs and use our http decorators like `post, get, delete` to make your methods an API

```controller.py
from backend.server.decorator import post

@query_controller("/my-controller")
class MyCustomController():
    ...

    @post("/answer")
    def answer(query: str):
        # Write code to express your logic for answer
        # This API will be exposed as POST /my-controller/answer
        ...
```

-   Import your custom controller class at `backend/modules/query_controllers/__init__.py`

```__init__.py
...
from backend.modules.query_controllers.sample_controller.controller import MyCustomController
```

> As an example, we have implemented sample controller in `backend/modules/query_controllers/example`. Please refer for better understanding
