    Data Trends: Describe any notable trends or patterns visible in the data. This may include increasing/decreasing trends, seasonality, outliers, etc.
    Key Insights: Extract key insights or observations from the charts. What do the charts reveal about the underlying data? Are there any significant findings that stand out?
    Data Points: Identify specific data points or values represented in the charts, especially those that contribute to the overall analysis or insights.
    Comparisons: Compare different charts within the same image or compare data points within a single chart. Highlight similarities, differences, or correlations between datasets.
    Conclude with a summary of the key findings from your analysis and any recommendations based on those findings.
